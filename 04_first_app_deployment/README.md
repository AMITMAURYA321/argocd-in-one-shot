# Chapter 4: First App Deployment with ArgoCD

In this chapter, we will learn how to deploy applications with ArgoCD using **three different approaches**:  

1. **UI Approach** â†’ NGINX example  
2. **CLI Approach** â†’ Apache example  
3. **Declarative Approach** â†’ Online Shop example  

Each method has its use cases, but only the **Declarative approach** aligns with the principles of GitOps.

      git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/argocd-demos.git
      ```   

Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub Username.

This repo contains the manifest files that are need to apply all three approaches

##  Learning Paths

We will explore three different methods to deploy applications using ArgoCD. Each method has its own advantages and is suited for different scenarios.

ðŸ‘‰ Click below to explore each approach step by step:

1. [UI Approach (NGINX Example)](./ui_approach/nginx/README.md)  
   - Deploy app via ArgoCD Dashboard  
   - Good for beginners and demos  

2. [CLI Approach (Apache Example)](./cli_approach/apache/README.md)  
   - Deploy app via ArgoCD CLI (`argocd app create`)  
   - Good for admins and operators  

3. [Declarative Approach (Online Shop Example)](./declarative_approach/online_shop/README.md)  
   - Deploy app via **Application CRD (YAML in Git)**  
   - True GitOps â†’ reproducible, auditable, production-ready

##  Comparison: UI vs CLI vs Declarative Approaches

| Approach       | How App is Created | Where Config Lives | Best For | Limitations |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|----------|-------------|
| **UI** (NGINX) | Create app via **ArgoCD Dashboard** | In **Cluster only** | Learning, demos, POCs | Not reproducible, not version-controlled |
| **CLI** (Apache) | `argocd app create ...` via **CLI** | In **Cluster only** | Operators, quick scripting | Still imperative, config not in Git |
| **Declarative** (Online Shop) | Apply **Application CRD YAML** | In **Git + Cluster** | Production, teams, real GitOps | Initial setup effort needed |

---

##  Key Takeaways

- **UI** â†’ Fast & visual â†’ great for learning, but **not GitOps**.  
- **CLI** â†’ Scriptable & powerful â†’ better than UI, but still **imperative**.  
- **Declarative** â†’ Version-controlled & reproducible â†’ the **true GitOps way** (what youâ€™ll use in production).
